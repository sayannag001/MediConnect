I tried to apply the knowledge which I gained during my training days.
In this project my contribution was Equipment Entity using SpringBoot(for backend), CreateHospital and Hopital Dashboard Using Angular and Bootstrap.The Login and Registration UI, Logo and the name of the application "MediConnect" was also my idea.
